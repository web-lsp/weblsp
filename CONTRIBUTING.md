# Contributing to Our Open Source Projects

First, a huge **thank you** for dedicating your time to helping us improve our projects ðŸ§¡

## Before Opening Issues

- **Do not report security vulnerabilities publicly** (e.g., in issues or discussions), please refer to our [security policy](https://github.com/web-lsp/weblsp/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
- **Do not create issues for ideas or suggestions.** Instead, share your thoughts in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/web-lsp/weblsp/discussions/categories/ideas).
- **Do not create issues for questions.** Instead, ask your question in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/web-lsp/weblsp/discussions/categories/q-a).
- **Check for duplicates.** Look through existing issues and discussions to see if your topic has already been addressed.
- Provide as much detail as possible. However, donâ€™t worry if itâ€™s incompleteâ€”we will help refine it!

## Before submitting Pull Requests (PRs)

- **Open an issue.** Before making significant changes, open an issue to discuss the problem and potential solutions with us.
- **Check for duplicates.** Look through existing PRs to see if your changes have already been submitted.
- **Avoid trivial changes.** Don't submit PRs for typos, grammar, or insignificant changes, as they will be **declined** without review.
- PRs don't need to be perfect. Submit your best effort, and we will gladly assist in polishing the work.

## Code of Conduct

Weâ€™re committed to fostering a welcoming and respectful community. Any issue, PR, or discussion that violates our [code of conduct](https://github.com/web-lsp/weblsp/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) will be deleted, and the authors will be **banned**.
