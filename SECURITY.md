## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues very seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it through our private reporting form: [Report a Security Vulnerability](https://github.com/web-lsp/weblsp/security/advisories/new).

### Guidelines for Reporting
- Do **not** report vulnerabilities publicly via issues or discussions.
- Please provide as much detail as possible about the vulnerability to help us investigate and resolve it quickly.

### What to Expect
- You will receive an acknowledgement of your report within **48 hours** (working days).
- We will work to fix the issue as soon as possible. In most cases, a fix will be published within **one week** of confirming the vulnerability.

### Post-Fix Communication
Once the fix is deployed, a **public security advisory** will be published here: [Security Advisories](https://github.com/web-lsp/weblsp/security/advisories).  
If applicable, credit will be given to the reporter for their responsible disclosure.

We greatly appreciate your efforts to help us maintain the security of our projects.
