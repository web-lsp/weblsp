A Language Service for CSS.

(Work In Progress) ~~It provides full-featured language support for HTML and CSS, including code completion, diagnostics, hover, and more.~~ Compliant with the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), CSSlsrs can be integrated into Language Servers written in Rust or JavaScript/TypeScript (via WebAssembly). Thanks to [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)'s parser, we deliver a fast and efficient language service, designed to improve your productivity when working with CSS.

This package contains the WASM implementation of [CSSlsrs](https://github.com/web-lsp/weblsp/tree/main/crates/csslsrs) for JavaScript/TypeScript Language Servers.
